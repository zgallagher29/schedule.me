## The Project ##
Do you have a convoluted looking class schedule generated by your university's ancient web portal? We're here to help. Schedule.Me will generate you a sweet, simple .png format schedule based on highlighted times/days you select in your browser. Find us on the chrome web store, and add to the project to get it working for your univerisity (if it doesn't already).

## Installation ##

## Features ##
* Generate a beautiful-looking schedule
* Grab any dates highlighted by user from the current webpage and temporarily store the info to parse and then generate a nice looking weekly-schedule png (Class goal) 
* Export schedule to Apple Calendar or Google Calendar (Future goal)

Please feel free to push with additions to your own custom scheduling systems, the more the better!
